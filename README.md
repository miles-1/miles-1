Hi, I’m @miles-1. I'm a graduate student at FSU.

I’m interested in ecology simulation, science computing tools, mathematics puzzles and STEM education/outreach.

I’m currently learning mathematical modeling for population/community ecology and epidemiology.

I'm looking to collaborate on STEM outreach projects (open-source software, curriculum development, etc).

Reach me at puzzle0pieces@gmail.com.
